5. Run the project:
    - Press `F5` in Visual Studio or run the project using:
      ```bash
      dotnet run
      ```

## Configuration

### Connection String

The database connection string is located in the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the project:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "ApplicationDbContextConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=movie-list-manager;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;
}
```

Modify the `Server` and `Database` fields to match your SQL Server configuration.

### Test Users and Passwords

The application comes preloaded with test users for demonstration purposes. Below are the default credentials:

| Username       | Password      | Role         |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| admin@admin.com | !Admin123     | Administrator |
| user@user.com  | !Admin123      | Regular User  |

You can modify or add more test users by updating the database or using the applicationâ€™s user management features.

## Application Flow

As a normal User you are able to add movies to your movie list (you can rate the movie and you can set the date you watched it, as well as some details about the movie).     
      You can edit the movies and remove them from the list.                        
You can also check the details of the movie you added.              

As an administrator you are able to see all of the movies added to the application. You can perform the same operations as the normal User.                   
You can also add Tags and Genres for normal Users to choose when creating movies.                      
You can perform basic CRUD operations on all entities (Movie, Tag, Genre).
